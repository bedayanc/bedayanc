## About Me
Hello there! I'm Bedayan Chakrabarty, an experienced crew scheduler with 6+ years of expertise in the aviation industry. Recently, I've developed a strong interest in data analysis and I'm currently exploring the field of data science. I believe that my background in crew scheduling, combined with my passion for data analysis, will allow me to make valuable contributions in this domain.

## Projects
In this repository, you'll find a collection of my data analysis projects. These projects aim to showcase my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets. Here are a few notable examples:

**Customer churn prediction of an E-commerce company (Capstone Project) -**
This project involved using various feature variables available in the Intercity customer churn dataset. Different Machine learning models like Regression, Classification, Ensemble techniques were used to analyze and predict customer churn outcomes. 


**Online retail Orders Analysis -**
The project involved using SQL on the order management functionality of an online retail store. The concepts of joins, sub-queries, SQL-clauses-statements-conditions were used to draw inferences from these case studies. 
Key skills: SQL, Databases, Joins, Sub queries, MySQL, PostgreSQL

**Dany Ma's 8-Week SQL Challenge -** Currently, I am actively participating in Dany Ma's esteemed 8-week SQL challenge. This enriching endeavor empowers me to strengthen my SQL skills through a series of real-world data analysis tasks.

## Skills
Data manipulation and analysis using Python (pandas, NumPy)
Data visualization using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn
Time series forecasting and predictive modeling

## Learning Journey
I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge in the field of data science. Currently, I am actively engaged in the following learning activities:

Online courses and tutorials on data analysis and machine learning
Practicing data analysis techniques on public datasets
Participating in data science communities and forums
Reading books and articles on data science and related topics
